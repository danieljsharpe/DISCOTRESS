##### DOCUMENTATION OF INPUT KEYWORDS AND ARGUMENTS FOR enhanced_kmc KINETIC MONTE CARLO SUITE #####

these keywords appear in the input file named "input.kmc"

mandatory input files containing the network information: stat_prob.dat, ts_conns.dat, ts_weights.dat

### MAIN KEYWORDS ###

NNODES <int>
  mandatory, number of nodes in the transition network

NEDGES <int>
  mandatory, number of (bidirectional) edges in the transition network

TRAJ <str>
  mandatory if not ENHANCED KPS, method for propagating individual kMC trajectories
  OPTIONS
    BKL - Bortz-Kalos-Lebowitz (aka n-fold way) rejection-free algorithm
    REJ - rejection algorithm
    LEAPFROG - kMC employing leapfrog moves

ENHANCED <str>
  mandatory, employ an enhanced sampling strategy for accelerating the observation of rare events
  OPTIONS
    WE - weighted ensemble sampling
    KPS - kinetic path sampling
    FFS - forward flux sampling
    ASKMC - accelerated superbasin kMC
    NEUS - non-equilibrium umbrella sampling
    NONE - no enhanced sampling strategy employed

MINAFILE <str> <int>
  mandatory, name of the file containing the node ID's (indexed from 1) belonging to the A (final) set and no. of nodes in A

MINBFILE <str> <int>
  mandatory, name of the file containing the node ID's (indexed from 1) belonging to the B (initial) set and no. of nodes in B


### OPTIONAL KEYWORDS RELATING TO ENHANCED SAMPLING ###

BINFILE <str> <int>
  mandatory if ENHANCED WE or ENHANCED KPS and not ADAPTIVEBINS
    name of the file containing the definitions of communities (single-column, indexed from zero, number of entries equal
      to the number of nodes in the network) and no. of communities. Is overridden by ADAPTIVEBINS

ADAPTIVEBINS
  mandatory if ENHANCED WE or ENHANCED KPS and not BINFILE, default False
    set the partitioning of the state space leveraged in WE-kMC and in kPS to be defined on-the-fly

BINTARGFILE <str>
  mandatory if ENHANCED WE and not ADAPTIVEBINS, name of the file containing the target number of trajectories in each bin
    (single-column, number of entries equal to the number of communities in the network)

BININITFILE <str>
  optional, if ENHANCED WE and not ADAPTIVEBINS, name of the file containing the initial trajectory probability distribution
    over nodes

TAU <float>
  mandatory if ENHANCED WE or ENHANCED KPS
    If WE, tau is the time between resampling trajectories
    If KPS, tau is the lag time at which the transition probability matrices are estimated

KPSKMCSTEPS <int>
  optional, if ENHANCED KPS, the number of standard BKL kMC steps to be performed after a kPS escape from
    a trapping basin

NELIM <int>
  mandatory if ENHANCED KPS, the maximum number of nodes that can be eliminated from the current trapping basin. If
    NELIM exceeds the number of nodes in the largest community, then all states of any trapping basin are always eliminated.
