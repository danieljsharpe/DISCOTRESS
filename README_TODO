check for bugs with:
valgrind --leak_check=yes discotress


To do:
-deadts member of Edge class only gets used in un-eliminating node in kPS (indicates that an edge no longer exists in the restored network) and
 in subsequent calculation of updated numbers of i<-j transitions. The h member of the Node and Edge classes only get used in kPS if not
 statereduction, and the dt member of the Edge class only gets used in kPS with certain state reduction methods.
 Could try and optimize memory usage and performance in these regards.

-discretetime is a member of Traj_Method but branchprobs is a member of Network; be consistent!

-in order for noloop to work, KPS needs to loop over nodes when incrementing path time
